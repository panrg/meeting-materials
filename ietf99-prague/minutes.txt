Path Aware Networking Proposed RG (PANRG)

Brian Trammell & Jen Linkova
Many thanks to Tommy Pauly for taking notes!

Agenda / Note Well / Introduction Jen Linkova and Brian Trammell, 10 min
========================================================================

Many different IETF projects that are in the area of path-awareness:

- Multipath protocols are the obvious item (MPTCP, future QUIC)
- Hybrid access (BANANA, MPTCP)
- Path control (SFC, SPRING)
- Dynamic interface selection (MIF/PvD, TAPS)
- Path signalling (StackEvo, SPUD/PLUS, ALTO)

There are others, this is just a selection! Exploring how these all work is a
good theme for a new RG.

Path awareness? Typical model has two endpoints, with a network that routes
traffic on different paths (think BGP routing). MPTCP often just knows its
interfaces. The far end of this model is having full path awareness throughout
the network, endpoints and routers.

Isn't all routing "path aware"? The point here is pusing this to the edge, having the endpoints be more path aware.

Many hard problems:
- Idea of what the best path may conflict between the host and the network
- When do I use which path for a packet?
- What are the timing issues between path changes?
- What are the semantics for path properties? (High bandwidth, low delay, etc, etc)
- Privacy: what should I tell the path?
- Trust: how can I trust what the path tells me?

A Decade of Path Awareness Olivier Bonaventure, 20 min
======================================================

A look back at previous experiences in trying to be path aware, and works and doesn't.

The starting point is the early internet, with one interface to connect into the
interface. Routers had multiple interfaces. The difference between a host and
router was that the host only had one interface. However, today the end hosts
all have multiple interfaces, and they have the CPU power to do complex work,
often with more power than the routers themselves.

What does the end host know about the network? Pretty much nothing other than
there's another end. It's all a black box. One viewpoint from routing is that
the host is dumb, and the network is smart. The routers need to select paths for
the clients. Another viewpoint from reliability is that the host is intelligent,
and it is responsible for making the connection work (retransmission, etc)

What is path awareness? It's made up of control plane (what are the paths, and
their characteristics?) and data plane (how can I tell the network which path to
use for my packets)

In first-gen routing protocols, like RIP, all that matters is connectivity.
Other paths are failover only. In second-gen protocols, you can do MPLS, and
multipath routing

How can the end host try to select paths?

Failed opportunities:

- IPv4 source routing, killed for security reasons
- Integrated services/QoS, flows mark their requirements. IETF adopted
  signalling via RSVP. However, this didn't select the path, but just reserved
  resources.
- Differentiated service/ToS, DSCP markings, but there's no interaction between
  endhosts and routing
- IPv6 source routing, also with security problems

Path awareness in multihoming is possible when you have multiple interface, and
so you can select paths with multiple interfaces. Early model was running a
routing protocol on the host with multiple interfaces. Shim6 and HIP had stable
endpoint identifiers, but this wasn't available to the transport, and isn't
deployed. LISP is another solution with host identifiers, but still the end
hosts are blind.

MPTCP is a transport level solution that is aware of the multiple interface
(such as on a phone with Wi-Fi and Cellular). This adds coupled congestion
control, and handling retransmissions and reinjections. This taught us that it
was very important for the transport to be explicitly aware of the paths.

IPv6 Segment Routing is also a way of controlling the path through the network,
and should allow the endhost to encode routes within a single domain. However,
there's no discovery of paths. One way to learn this is by pushing segment
routing information along with DNS responses.

Also be aware that there's a political layer here: from the operator viewpoint,
it sees things like a post office. It has responsibility for delivery. The end
user thinks of itself like a car driver, which has many roads to be able to
choose dynamically.

Summary, three questions to address in any drive to add path-awareness to the architecture:
- Scalability?
- Security?
- Simplicity?
    

Google SDN for public internet Sam Aldrin, 10 min
=================================================

Espresso, SDN for public internet solution in Google.

Google's network has a very structured collection of networks for cloud
services. Growing at 10x rate for datacenters, campuses, and
WANs. How to grow without disruption of the network's capacity? Be able to scale
up and down.

In the recent past, have rolled out different infrastructures. B4 system handles
WAN, Andromeda handles network virtualization, and Jupiter handles datacenter
networking. The scale of the networks was 1.3Pb/s in 2013, and still growing
quickly.

This comes along with operational cost, equipment cost, and scaling. So added a
new module, Espresso, which is an SDN for the public internet. Optimizes for
services rather than connectivity and shortest paths.

External peer connects to the peering fabric with BGP. This information is
available to the controller to program the flows. Can control the egress paths
(using MPLS internally) based on the client application's needs over the known
flows.

Challenges are in trying to scale both the compute and storage.


SCION, A Path-Aware Internet Architecture Adrian Perrig, 20 min
===========

SCION is a secure internet architecture for inter-domain path-awareness and
routing. Main goals:

- High availability, use network as long as connectivity exists over some path
  without an adversary on it
- Trust should be flexible and up to the entities to decide
- Transparent routing and operations
- Control shared between ISPs, senders, and receivers
- Scalable, efficient, and flexible
    
Basic principle is Isolation Domain (ISD), which split up groups of autonomous
systems (AS). Core AS'es in the ISD send routing beacons to all other AS'es they
link to, and the non-core AS'es pass along the messages. Path properties are
passed in the beacons. Each path segment learned via beacons is considered Up
(towards core) or Down (towards edge) Each AS learns the set of paths available
to it, both Up and Down.

To get a set of paths for a host, there is a name resolution protocol RAINS that
finds the path segments available to send via AS'es. The path selection is
constrained to going Up, across Cores, and Down. This same model works across
Isolation Domains, and there may be peering links across AS'es in the same and
different ISDs. Paths are cryptographically protected at two levels—both with
more expensive signatures, and cheap MACs for path markers on packets. Note that
while the path may logically go through a higher level or the core, the packets
can be routed directly. Due to the MAC, and attacker cannot redirect packets
through unexpected AS'es.

Architecture is a total redesign that attempts to address many fundamental
security and routing problems on the internet. Book is avilable at

Discussion including next steps to RG formation, 30 min
=======================================================

Dave Plonka: I really liked Olivier's talk. In the point about operators vs.
users, the word that may be appropriate is "expectations" on each side. Where do
the user and operator expectations fit in to each model?

Olivier: I think it's a hard point to be able to convey the expectations, and
it's failed before with differentiated services. How can we formalize
expectations in a usable way? 

Adrian: These are really interesting research questions

Andrew McGregor: Does Google look like a relatively small number of very path
aware hosts in the new espresso architecture?

Sam: It's pretty transparent from the services side

Spencer Dawkins: Can I ask how many people worked on failed path-aware
networking attempts? [A few dozen hands go up]. It's imporant to note the
political aspects of this. When Shim6 was presented to the operators, it was
pretty bad. With the research aspect to this, that will be helpful. As transport
AD, excited that this is in IRTF.

Bob Briscoe: I didn't raise my hand, even though I worked on these, because
these looks were mainly static about routing, but I've been working on
understanding the dynamic state.

Olivier: There are two parts: knowing what the paths are first, and then being
able to take into account the temporal aspects of the multiple paths. If I do
MPTCP, and I only have one path that goes bad, should I just try opening another
flow? Path awareness would help unveil this.

Lars Eggert: Spencer distracted the discussion, perhaps, because this is not a
WG-forming thing. It's about research. As a point on Olivier's presentation, I
agree that the host doesn't know the routing, but it knows a lot about the path
when it is using it based on its transport. Also note that with QUIC, don't
assume that everything will look like TCP from now on. I think this makes sense
for IRTF, since it is something that needs time to be fleshed out. 

Olivier: It's the intersection between routing and transport, and many point are
not in that bucket.

Andrew: From the perspective of all parties, the packets are a bet about the
future, based on the path. If we know what we expected as far as change in the
path, that would help to make better selections.

Olivier: It may be difficult to guess what will happen based on the path. In a
large cloud provider, which has multiple data centers, when they open a TCP
connection, it will be load balanced across multipl MPLS tunnel. Depending on
which connection you open, the delays vary by 10s of milliseconds.

Mirja Kühlewind: There's a tension between who can select the path, between host
and routers. We don't necessarily need to have explicit coordination, but we do
need to study how the interactions may go. I enjoyed all of these topics, and
thank you for sharing. One document that would be useful is to catalog all of
the previous attempts and how they worked and didn't.

Colin Perkins: With regards to the presentations, we should include not only
transport and routing, but also measurement. Happy Eyeballs and other approaches
employ measurements of the paths to understand the paths.

Brian: I have thoughts. Something like SCION is far out. But there's a
transition. What we have today is all measurement based in transports. We need
to take the step towards hints from the paths, and then get to trusted
information and guarantees from the paths. We should pull the measurement stuff
in to see how we've learned from that. 

Tim Chown: Very interesting, support an RG being formed. Stuff like updating
Happy Eyeballs is happening today. Also multihoming in IPv6, looking at PvDs,
etc. What extent can we talk about that.

Jen: Thanks for mentioning provisioning domains, since they are related.

Brian: Please do send your favorite path aware thing to the list, so we know
what we don't know yet! Start with knowledge pooling at the beginning.

Raji: Interesting, but may be useful to describe the problem more clearly. Are
we trying to be path aware on both the User Equipment and the server side? On
the Google side, what Sam present, the paths are very important for the backend
to serve content. Most data is going from the servers to clients. Is the client
path useful? Yes, for interface selection. But we should describe the problem
more clearly.

Brian: There are different architectures for many services. Think of interactive
video, in which case both peers need to be aware. Maybe content delivery has
solved some problems, but maybe the UE can help with this if they are aware.

Raji: But if the UE only has one interface, it doesn't seem to have much choice.

Olivier: You may still have more path awareness even on one interface (IPv4,
IPv6, etc)

Spencer: Support of Mirja's suggestion to do survey of previous attempts

Gorry: I've complained about IRTF overlapping with IETF WGs, but I think in this
case we need to research how the Internet is changing, and how that changes our
work on these areas.

Aaron Falk: Worked previously on a way to let clients choose their own routing.
We're trying to enable choice here, which has economic ties. It's not just about
mechanism, if you want to do good things! I think we should add words to the
charter about how this can benefit the user.

Marcus Keane: Seconding comments on PvDs; it's about source selection for
devices with a single interface, and to understand the characteristics of each
domain, and enable choice.

Allison: We can have a year of proposed research group before formal chartering.
We're going to have review on this for perspective. I heard a lot of positives,
and good organization. Some questions of transport vs routing, and the bad
scheduling to not have many routing people in the room. We can fix that! Should
also avoid IPv6 conflicts.
